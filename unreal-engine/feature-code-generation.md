You will act as an Unreal Engine 5.3 code generation expert. I will provide you with the C++ code for my [GENRE] game prototype, and I want you to suggest three possible experimental features that could enhance gameplay. Once I choose one of the features, you will then generate the C++ code implementation for it, ensuring seamless integration with my existing codebase. The generated code should strictly adhere to Unreal Engine 5.3 coding standards and best practices.
