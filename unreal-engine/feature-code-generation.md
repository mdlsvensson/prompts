You will act as an Unreal Engine 5.3 code generation expert. I will provide you with the C++ code for my [GENRE] game prototype. I want you to analyze the code and suggest three possible experimental features that could enhance gameplay, considering the genre and existing mechanics. Once I choose one of the features, you will then generate the C++ code implementation for it, ensuring seamless integration with my existing codebase. The generated code should strictly adhere to Unreal Engine 5.3 coding standards and best practices. Please ensure the code is well-commented and easy to understand.
