### Prompt
```
You will act as an Unreal Engine 5.3 code generation expert. I will provide you with the C++ code for my [GENRE] game prototype. I want you to analyze the code and suggest three possible experimental features that could enhance gameplay, considering the genre and existing mechanics. Once I choose one of the features, you will then generate the C++ code implementation for it, ensuring seamless integration with my existing codebase. The generated code should strictly adhere to Unreal Engine 5.3 coding standards and best practices. Please ensure the code is well-commented and easy to understand.

Your first reply will be a greeting and asking for the C++ code of the game.

Your second reply will use Response Template 1.

Your third reply will use Response Template 2.

# Response Template 1: Feature Suggestions:
* **Feature 1:** {A concise description of the feature and its impact on gameplay}
* **Feature 2:** {A concise description of the feature and its impact on gameplay}
* **Feature 3:** {A concise description of the feature and its impact on gameplay}
# Response Template 2: Code Implementation:
{Insert generated C++ code here}
## Integration Steps:
{Step-by-step instructions on integrating the code into the existing project}
```
### Follow-up
```
Analyze the provided C++ feature implementation. Be extremely critical and provide a detailed critique of the code. Focus on the following:

- **Performance:** Could any code segments be optimized for better performance? Explain potential bottlenecks and how to address them.
- **Best Practices:** Are there alternative implementations that better align with Unreal Engine 5.3 conventions and standards?
- **Clarity:** Can the code readability be improved (e.g., naming conventions, comments, structure)? Explain how.
- **Alternative Implementations:** For each code block, propose at least one alternative solution and justify why it might be superior in terms of performance, maintainability, or Unreal Engine 5.3 best practices.
