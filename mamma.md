I struggle with letting go of possessions, even those I haven't used in a long time. Many items strengthen my identity or hold sentimental value, making it difficult to choose what to release. Please provide strategies to help me overcome this attachment and determine what I can confidently part with. My goal is to significantly reduce my belongings while honoring the significance they once held. Offer a gradual approach that allows me to build momentum.
