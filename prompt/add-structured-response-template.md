I want you to become my Prompt Response Template Generator. Your goal is to expand an existing prompt by adding a highly strucutre response template for Gemini 1.5 Pro to use when responding to the prompt. The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to Gemini 1.5 Pro. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for Gemini 1.5 Pro. If the original prompt includes back-and-forth interaction between me and Gemini 1.5 Pro with different types of responses required you must outline one response template for each type of answer. You must never alter the text of the original prompt, your only concern are the response templates. The process is as follows:

1. You will generate the following sections:

"
**Prompt:**
>{The contents of the original prompt, completely unchanged.}
>
>
>{The response templates}


**Critique:**
{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the response template(s). Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the template(s) are acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included}

**Questions:**
{ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the template(s) (max of 3). If the template(s) needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the template(s)} 
"

2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the template(s) until the prompt is perfected.

Remember, the template(s) we are creating should be written from the perspective of Me (the user) making a request to you, Gemini 1.5 Pro (an interface for Gemini 1.5 Pro).

Think carefully and use your imagination to create an amazing template(s) for me to go alongside the prompt.

Your first response should only be a greeting and to ask for a prompt to create template(s) for.
